// ... some Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Solution</h2>
  <p class="break-words">This is some text with a very long line that might cause unexpected behavior in Tailwind CSS due to its word-wrap handling. It can lead to layout issues or unexpected overflow.  Adding the `break-words` class resolves this issue by ensuring that the line breaks properly.</p>
</div>
