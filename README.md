# Tailwind CSS Unexpected Overflow with Long Text Lines

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to how it handles exceptionally long lines of text within elements.  Standard word-wrap might not sufficiently break excessively long words or sentences, leading to layout irregularities.  The bug is less likely to surface with typical text content but can appear with unusually long single-line strings or dynamically generated text that lacks proper word-break handling.

## Bug Description

The core issue is that when a line of text within a Tailwind-styled element significantly surpasses the element's width, the default word-wrap behavior can fail, causing overflow or unexpected rendering. This often stems from the lack of explicit word-break properties.

## Solution

The solution involves adding the `break-words` utility class to the affected element. This forces the text to break at any point to prevent overflow.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe the unexpected overflow of text in the paragraph element.
4. Open `bugSolution.html` in your browser.
5. Observe how `break-words` resolves the overflow issue.
